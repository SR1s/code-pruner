# Output Patterns

Templates and patterns for consistent skill output.

## Response Templates

### Success Response
```
[Action completed successfully]

- What was done: [brief description]
- Result: [key outcome]
- Next steps: [if applicable]
```

### Error Response
```
[Action failed]

- Error: [what went wrong]
- Cause: [why it happened]
- Fix: [how to resolve]
```

### Progress Response
```
[Step X of Y]

- Current: [what's happening now]
- Remaining: [what's left]
- ETA: [estimated completion]
```

## Code Example Standards

- Include language identifier in code blocks
- Show expected output when helpful
- Keep examples minimal but complete
- Comment non-obvious steps

## Documentation Patterns

- Start with the "why" before the "how"
- Use active voice
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Link to references for deep dives
